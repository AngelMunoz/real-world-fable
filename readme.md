# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### [Fable](https://fable.io), [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) and [F#](https://fsharp.org) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://real-world-fable.netlify.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Fable](https://fable.io), [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) and [F#](https://fsharp.org)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Fable](https://fable.io), [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/) and [F#](https://fsharp.org)** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
